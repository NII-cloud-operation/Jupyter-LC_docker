# LC4RI: Literate Computing for Reproducible Infrastructure

*Literate Computing for Reproducible Infrastructure* is our project, which utilizes Jupyter Notebook in the operational engineering area. The project seeks collaborative communication leading to share and improve operational workflows of researchers, educators, engineers, and other practitioners for reproducible computing.  Jupyter Notebook enables us to describe automated operations with complementary principles, which aim to **keep humans in the automated operational loop**. We pursue resilient, *human-centered automated operations* (機械化) that should not excessively rely on *no-ops automation* (自動化).

Notebooks are machine-reproducible, human-readable, and human-substitutable procedures, which improve efficiency and robustness of operations **without pushing aside humans from black-boxed automation**. Keeping our ability to learn and grow, we can foster a resilient engineering team by encouraging sharing operational knowledge and developing skillfulness.
